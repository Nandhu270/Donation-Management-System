            Campaign Overview: COHAP Outreach Corporation, a 501(c)(3)
            non-profit organization, is on a mission to end homelessness and
            create stable futures for those most vulnerable. We are dedicated to
            protecting veterans, domestic violence survivors, formerly
            incarcerated individuals, and young adults aging out of foster care
            from the threat of homelessness.

            We believe in empowering individuals to rebuild their lives, thrive,
            and escape the cycle of homelessness. By providing safe and secure
            housing, along with essential support services, we aim to equip
            these individuals with the tools and confidence they need to
            succeed.

            With your help, we can raise $600,000 to secure these housing units
            and create safe environments for those at risk of homelessness. This
            will help reduce the growing numbers of homeless individuals in our
            communities and provide them with a path to stability.

            too smallâ€”whether it helps cover one night of safe shelter or
            contributes toward the purchase of a home, your support matters.
